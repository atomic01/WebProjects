## 🧠 Overview
This project was created as part of an early university exercise to build a multi-page website with:
- Static and dynamic city pages (HTML + CSS)
- A simple comment submission system (PHP + MySQL)
- Basic client-side interactivity using JavaScript

While not a polished or production-ready site, it served as an experiment in combining **frontend and backend logic** for the first time.
