# 🌐 Web Projects

This repository contains a collection of my **web development projects** created over time — from early coursework experiments to real-world website implementations.  
Each project demonstrates a different stage of my learning and application of **frontend, backend, and full-stack development** principles.

## 💡 Notes
- These projects represent my **progression from academic coursework to practical web development**.  
- While some are no longer live, the repositories preserve their structure, logic, and design for reference.  
- More recent projects (e.g., [17.fitness](https://17.fitness/)) showcase modern tools like **WordPress**, **Elementor**, and **Blocksy**.
